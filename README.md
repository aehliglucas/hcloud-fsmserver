## hcloud FsmServer
This small collection of Terraform and Ansible artifacts is developed to provide an easy way of setting up FlightStripManager-Server instances in Hetzner Cloud for virtual air traffic controlling.
The FlightStripManager client can be found [here](https://hawk-softworks.de/fsm).

Please note that I am not associated to Hawk Softworks, the developers of FlightStripManager, in any way.
My only goal was to have an easy-to-deploy and easy-to-destroy solution for managing traffic in a synchronized and realistic way on IVAO or VATSIM.
